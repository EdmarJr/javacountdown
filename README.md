javacountdown.net
=================

This GitHub repo serves as the source code for the upcoming javacountdown.net site built by the community that 
mimics the spirit of ie6countdown.net. That is, to encourage users to move to the latest and greatest Java! 

It's being built on Java 7 and Java EE6 and is hosted on [Jelastic](http://www.layershift.com/hosting/jelastic-cloud) by [Layershift](http://www.layershift.com/about/why-layershift).

As well as the map with global percentages, a simple message will be shown to users:

*"15 years ago an amazing language was born. Its name was Java. Now that we’re in 2013, the world has changed and 
Java along with it! For Java versions 4, 5 and 6, it’s time to say goodbye.*

*This website and it's community is dedicated to helping Java 4, 5 & 6 usage drop to less
than 1% worldwide, so hundreds of millions of users are safer and 9-10 million developers 
are more productive.*

*Move to Java 7 today!"*

An addendum for some enterprises will also be displayed:

*"If you really can't move today, then at least get a support contract for Java in business license from Oracle 
so that you and your customers are kept safe."*

Forks and Pull Requests to complete this site are welcome!
